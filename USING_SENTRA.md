# Using SENTRA — step by step

*Sense the Risk · Stop the Incident*

This is the click-by-click flow. For the rules the system must be operated under,
how to train on real labels, and what has to change before a plant deployment,
read [INSTRUCTION.md](INSTRUCTION.md) instead — this file is the daily walkthrough.

Every button name below is the exact text on screen.

## Part 0 — Start it once

```bash
cd E:\SIF                       # wherever the project lives
.venv\Scripts\python.exe app2.py
```

The window opens on the **Workflow map**. That page is the whole system in eight
cards, and every card has a live status line telling you what is ready **on this
machine right now**. Green means ready, amber means it needs something first, red
means a dependency is missing and that capability is off.

**Read the map before you do anything else.** It answers "why is this not
working?" before you have to ask.

### One-time setup, in the order that matters

| # | Do this | Where | You are done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Download / verify models** (workflow card 2) — the same control on the Engines page reads **Download / verify OCR models (once)** | Workflow card 2, or Engines page | Card 2 reads `PaddleOCR ready — models are on this machine … No download needed` |
| 2 | **Start Ollama and pull a model** | A terminal: `ollama pull llama3.2`, then `python -m sif.llm` to confirm | The check ends `Translation works`, and card 3 reads `Ollama ready — llama3.2` |

> **Card 3 green means translation will actually run.** It checks that the
> server answers *and* that the model you configured is pulled — a server that
> is up with the wrong model reads amber, not green, because it would accept a
> translation request and fail it silently. If you pulled a different model,
> put its exact name (from `ollama list`) into Engines → **Model** → **Apply**.
| 3 | **Check the encoder** | Engines page | Header reads `encoder: transformer` (or `hashing`, which works offline) |
| 4 | **Put your name in** | Human review → **Reviewer** box | Your name appears on every decision and audit entry |

Steps 1 and 2 are once per machine, not once per session. If card 2 still says
"download once per machine" after step 1, run `python -m sif.ocr --list` — it
prints the cache directory and what is in it.

## Part 1 — Get reports in

Three ways in. Pick the one that matches what you have.

### A. A spreadsheet export (the usual case)

1. **Ingest and OCR** → **Import CSV export** (or `Ctrl+O`).
2. Choose your file. `samples/near_miss_reports.csv` is a worked example.
3. The importer reads the narrative column — `report`, `description`,
   `narrative`, `text`, `observation`, `details` or `incident` — and uses
   `report_id` / `id` / `ref` as the reference. Any other columns are ignored.
4. Rows analyse as they arrive. The status bar counts them off.

> **Note:** `site`, `date` and `activity` columns are *not* read. SENTRA derives
> location and activity from the words of the report itself. Searching for a site
> name will therefore find nothing — search for what the narrative says.

### B. Documents — PDFs, scans, photographs

1. **Ingest and OCR** → **Add documents (PDF, PNG, JPG, TIFF, TXT)** (or `Ctrl+D`).
2. **Scans only:** set **OCR LANGUAGE** to the script on a scanned page or
   photograph, so the right recogniser reads it. Text files and PDFs with a text
   layer need nothing: SENTRA reads each report's language from its own text.
3. Each file is read: a PDF with a text layer is read directly (fast, exact); a
   scan or photograph goes through PaddleOCR. The **Extracted documents** table
   shows which backend was used, the page count and the OCR confidence.
4. The text is split into reports: a report form (letterhead, narrative,
   "Immediate action:") stays one report; a shift log splits into its entries;
   `---` separator lines divide a file of several reports. The Language column
   then names each file's language (`Hindi`, `Tamil`, `5 languages`...).
5. Click **Analyse extracted blocks**. (**Clear extraction list** drops what is
   waiting without analysing it.)

**A low OCR confidence is a warning, not a detail.** If it reads below about
0.60, check the extracted text preview before trusting the analysis.

### C. Paste one report

1. Type or paste into the **Report text** box.
2. Blank lines separate reports — paste five at once if you have five.
3. Click **Analyse text**.

Or click **Load 5 seed incidents** to see the whole system work with no data of
your own.

**The same report analysed twice replaces itself.** Import a corpus, fix a
column, import it again — you get one copy, and the status bar says how many
repeats it replaced. To start genuinely empty: **File → Clear the corpus**
(your review decisions survive; they belong to the reports).

---

## Part 2 — Read what came back

### Step 1 — Dashboard

The five tiles across the top:

| Tile | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| TOTAL REPORTS | Everything analysed in this corpus |
| SIF-POTENTIAL | High energy **and** a failed barrier — the ones that could have killed someone |
| MEAN RISK SCORE | Ordinal 0–100, for ranking a queue. Not a probability |
| AWAITING REVIEW | Still owed to a person. Falls as you work the queue |
| ENGINE AGREEMENT | How often the trained model agrees with the pipeline |

Then the three exposure charts. **The failed-barrier chart is usually the most
actionable** — it names the control that keeps failing, and a control is
something you can fix.

**Risk trend.** Choose the range - **Today** (hour by hour), **Week** or
**Month** (day by day), **Year** (month by month) or **All** - and **Line** or
**Bar**. Every range ends now. Hover a point for that hour, day or month's
figures; the peaks, the average and the total are underneath.

**Risk profile (spider chart).** The same reports on fixed spokes - **IOGP
rule**, **Energy** or **Barrier**. Grey is all reports, navy SIF potential, red
critical. A spoke that bulges is where exposure is concentrated; hover it for
the counts. Compare this month's shape with last month's by switching the
trend range.

### Step 2 — Reports and evidence

The full matrix, one row per report. Click any row and the right-hand panel shows
the whole case: verdict, risk, the five extracted fields, and **EVIDENCE AND
REASONING** — the exact cues that produced the verdict and the decision path.

If you cannot see why a report was flagged, it is in that panel. If the panel
does not convince you, that is what the review queue is for.

### Step 3 — Risk hotspots

Sites, activities, rule-at-a-location and repeat barrier failures that occur more
than once, **ranked by SIF-precursor density, not by volume**. A small busy site
cannot hide behind a large quiet one, and a 2-of-2 group cannot outrank a
20-of-30 one (a Wilson lower bound discounts the small sample).

A hotspot is a *system* problem. Route it to the asset owner, not to the person
who filed the report.

---

## Part 3 — Work the review queue

This is the part that makes the product improve. **Human review** in the sidebar,
or **Open review queue** on workflow card 7.

### The queue

Sorted by how much a human is needed, not by date:

| Trigger | What happened | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Disagreement** | Rules and the semantic model reached opposite conclusions | Decide which is right — highest-value row in the system |
| **Model disagreement** | The trained model contradicts the pipeline | Same, and your call becomes a label |
| **LLM disagreement** | The local model contradicts the pipeline | Same |
| **Critical risk** | Scored in the top band | Verify before it drives an intervention |
| **Thin evidence** | Very little extractable text | Usually a reporting-quality problem — go back to the reporter |
| **Unclassified exposure** | High energy, no rule matched | Vocabulary the system has not seen |
| **Energy, no barrier** | Energy and a rule matched, no failed barrier found | Confirm the barrier held, or name the one that did not |
| **SIF potential** | A confirmed finding outside every trigger above (High or Medium band, clean extraction, no disagreement) | The catch-all: nothing the engine confirms is ever closed unseen - verify it like any other |

If a report's own wording downplays what it describes ("nothing serious", "no
big deal") while the facts say otherwise, the reason line says so explicitly:
*"the report's own wording downplays this... the finding rests on the extracted
facts, not the tone."* Decide on the facts in the fields above, not the tone of
the narrative.

### Deciding one

1. Click a row. The whole case appears on the right.
2. **Check the language bar** above the narrative:
   - `ENGLISH — TRANSLATED FROM TAMIL FOR REVIEW` → you are reading the English;
     **Show the original** is beside it.
   - `ENGLISH AS WRITTEN` → nothing to translate.
   - `NOT TRANSLATED …` in red → **stop**. Run `python -m sif.llm`, fix what it
     names, and re-analyse the document. A verdict
     on a narrative the engine could not read is a verdict about the language.
3. Read **WHAT EACH ENGINE SAID** — rules, semantic, model, LLM, side by side.
4. Decide with the keyboard:

   | Key | Decision | Means |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **1** | Confirm SIF potential | This could have killed someone |
   | **2** | Not SIF potential | It could not |
   | **3** | Unclear — need more information | You looked and cannot call it |

5. The bench **advances by itself**. Work the queue without touching the mouse.

**A note is optional but it is what makes the decision reusable** six months
later. One sentence: *why*.

### Rules of the bench

- **Unclear is not a label.** It records that an expert looked and could not
  call it — different from "not SIF" — and training never sees it.
- **Overturning the engine is normal and valuable.** The row says so, and those
  are the reports that teach the system most.
- **Decisions are written to disk as you make them.** An hour of queue work
  survives a crash.
- **Changing a decision supersedes it without erasing it.** The **Decision
  trail** tab holds every entry ever recorded, and exports to CSV.
- **Undo the last decision** is for the misclick, not for a change of mind.

---

## Part 4 — Let it learn

Once the queue has produced decisions: **Engines** → **Train XGBoost on the
analysed corpus**, or **Train model** on workflow card 8.

The status line tells you which labels it used, and the difference matters:

- **`on N reviewed decision(s)`** — it learned from your experts. This is the
  real thing. Needs 8+ decided reports carrying both verdicts.
- **`on N pipeline verdict(s)`** — not enough human labels yet, so it learned to
  reproduce the rules. Useful for speed; it adds no knowledge.

**No decisions yet, and want a model today?** There is a labelled starting
corpus in `samples/training_corpus.csv` — 56 reports, 33 precursors and 23
controls, labelled from the safety logic rather than from the engine's output:

```bash
python train_model.py samples/training_corpus.csv --encoder hashing
```

It is synthetic, so treat it as a bootstrap: it gets a model off the ground on
day one and is worth exactly nothing compared with your own reviewed decisions.
Retrain on those as soon as the queue has produced them.

Metrics land on the **Analytics** page with the feature importances — in safety
language, not `f37`. The run is logged to MLflow, so you can compare this model
against the last one and answer "which model was live, and what had it seen?"

**Recall is the number to watch.** A missed precursor is an incident nobody
looked at; a false positive costs a reviewer two minutes.

---

## Part 5 — Get things out

| You want | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| The analysed corpus | **File → Export results CSV** (`Ctrl+S`) |
| A written safety bulletin over the corpus | **File → Generate safety bulletin...** (`Ctrl+B`) - headline numbers, what is driving risk, repeat exposures, and exactly what still needs a person, as a `.txt` file |
| The decision trail | Human review → **Decision trail** tab → **Export the trail as CSV** |
| The audit trail | **File → Export the audit trail**, or Settings → Audit trail |
| What the software did | Settings → **System logging** (rotates) |
| Who did what, and when | Settings → **Audit trail** (append-only, never rotates) |

The audit trail separates **SYSTEM** (what the software did by itself) from
**FUNCTIONALITY** (what you asked for and what came back). Filter with **Show**,
then export.

---

## The daily loop, in six lines

1. Import the shift's reports.
2. Glance at the dashboard — how many carry fatal potential?
3. Work the review queue until it is clear. Keys 1, 2, 3.
4. Act on hotspots: fix the control, not the incident.
5. Retrain when you have decisions worth learning from.
6. Export the trail if anyone asks who decided what.

## When something looks wrong

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Card 2 keeps saying models download | Cache empty, or `PADDLE_PDX_CACHE_HOME` moved | `python -m sif.ocr --list`, then `python -m sif.ocr en` |
| Card 3 red, `not pulled` | Ollama running but the model is missing | Run `ollama list` to see what you actually have, then type that exact name into Engines → **Model** and press **Apply** |
| Report shows a red NOT TRANSLATED bar | Ollama was down, or the model was not pulled, **when that report was analysed** | Run `python -m sif.llm` - it says which of the two, and prints the exact command to fix it. Then **re-analyse the document**: translation happens at analysis time and is never applied retrospectively |
| A report you expected to flag did not | The barrier phrasing may not be in the vocabulary | It still reaches the queue — confirm it there, and the label teaches the model |
| Corpus counts look doubled | Older builds appended repeats | Fixed; **File → Clear the corpus** and re-import to reset |
| `encoder: hashing` when you wanted the transformer | No network, or the model is not cached | Engines → Semantic encoder → *Transformer*, then re-analyse |

## Checking the engine yourself

```bash
python evaluation/evaluate.py            # score against 40 labelled reports
python evaluation/evaluate.py --errors   # every miss, with its text
python -m unittest discover -p "test_*.py"   # the full suite
```

Add your own reports to `evaluation/labelled_reports.csv` — label them from the
safety logic, keep the negative controls, and re-run. That is how you find out
whether SENTRA works on **your** corpus rather than on ours.
