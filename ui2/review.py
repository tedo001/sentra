"""The human review bench.

Card 7 of the workflow map. Everything else in the console produces an opinion;
this is where a person turns opinions into a decision, and the decision into a
label the model can learn from.

The page is built around how the work is actually done. An HSE reviewer does not
browse: they work a queue, one report at a time, and the thing that decides
whether the queue gets worked is how many seconds each row costs. So:

* **The queue is on the left, the report is on the right.** Selecting a row shows
  the whole case - the narrative, the extracted fields, every opinion, the cues
  that produced it, and why this report was queued.
* **Three decisions, three keys.** Confirm, reject, or say it is unclear, on
  ``1``/``2``/``3``. After a decision the bench advances to the next report on
  its own, so a queue can be worked without touching the mouse.
* **Unclear is not a label.** It records that an expert looked and could not
  call it, which is a different fact from "not SIF" and must never be trained on.
* **Nothing is closed automatically** and nothing is hidden: the trail tab shows
  every decision ever recorded, including the ones that were changed.
* **Overturning the engine is first-class.** When the expert disagrees with the
  verdict, the row says so - those are the reports that teach the system most.

The view is passive. It renders what the controller gives it and emits signals;
it never touches the pipeline, the decision log or the disk.
