"""Document ingestion - reading reports that arrive as files, not text.

Field reports rarely arrive as clean CSV rows: they are scanned shift logs,
photographed permit forms, exported PDFs and Word-printed observation sheets.
This module turns any of those into the plain text the pipeline consumes.

Backends, tried in order and recorded on the result so the operator knows what
read the document:

``text``
    Plain ``.txt`` / ``.md`` / ``.csv`` - read directly.
``pdf-text``
    PDFs that carry a text layer - extracted without OCR, which is faster and
    exact.
``paddleocr``
    Scanned PDFs and images - `PaddleOCR <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR>`_
    with angle classification, which handles the rotated phone photographs that
    make up most site-submitted evidence. Per-line confidence is averaged into
    :attr:`ExtractedDocument.confidence` so a bad scan can be routed to a human
    instead of silently producing garbage.

PaddleOCR is optional: when it is not installed, image input reports a clear,
actionable error and PDFs still work through their text layer.
